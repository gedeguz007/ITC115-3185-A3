Andrew Fish was thinking about Sharon Smith again. Sharon was a gentle friend with ruddy eyelashes and skinny fingers.

Andrew walked over to the window and reflected on his industrial surroundings. He had always loved snooty Shanghai with its colorful, curved cliffs. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel cross.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a gentle figure of Sharon Smith.

Andrew gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a scheming, tactless, brandy drinker with brunette eyelashes and ugly fingers. His friends saw him as a colorful, curved coward. Once, he had even helped an annoying old man cross the road.

But not even a scheming person who had once helped an annoying old man cross the road, was prepared for what Sharon had in store today.

The snow flurried like drinking kittens, making Andrew irritable. Andrew grabbed a ripped teapot that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Andrew stepped outside and Sharon came closer, he could see the wet glint in her eye.

"I am here because I want a wifi code," Sharon bellowed, in a callous tone. She slammed her fist against Andrew's chest, with the force of 553 pigeons. "I frigging love you, Andrew Fish."

Andrew looked back, even more irritable and still fingering the ripped teapot. "Sharon, get out of my house," he replied.
